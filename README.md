## Hospital Task

TASK INSTRUCTIONS:
===========================

Consider this scenario:

A patient goes to a hospital for medical diagnosis. At the reception, the patient is registered into the organization and a ticket number is generated for them to see a doctor. During the consultation in the doctor’s room, the patient is requested to proceed to the laboratory for some tests to be performed. The patient proceeds to the laboratory after this.


The doctor receives the laboratory report, adds the patient’s diagnosis and reccommended prescription.


A medical report report is generated, detailing the patient’s lab test and results, dignosis and prescription. The patient is given the generated medical report.


Your task is to come up with a  small program that can be used to manage this process, from the time the patient walks in to the time that they leave the medical facility
